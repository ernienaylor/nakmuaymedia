# Vercel Build Fix Summary

## Issue

During the Vercel build process, an error was encountered with the `/_not-found` page:

```
Error: useTheme must be used within a ThemeContextProvider
```

This error occurred because the static generation process was trying to render components that use the `useTheme` hook, but the `ThemeContextProvider` was not properly initialized during static generation.

## Solution

We implemented a completely standalone approach for the not-found pages to fix the issue:

1. **Created a standalone not-found page**: Updated `src/app/not-found.tsx` to use inline styles instead of Tailwind CSS classes and UI components.

2. **Updated the 404 page**: Applied the same standalone approach to `src/pages/404.tsx`.

3. **Removed UI component dependencies**: Eliminated imports of UI components like `Button` that might internally use the theme context.

## Key Changes

1. **Inline styles instead of components**: Used inline styles for all styling to avoid dependencies on external components or CSS.

2. **Simplified HTML structure**: Created a basic layout with header, main content, and footer using standard HTML elements.

3. **CSS variables with fallbacks**: Used CSS variables with fallbacks (e.g., `var(--background, white)`) to ensure the page looks good even without the theme context.

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Deploy the changes to Vercel.
2. Check that the build completes successfully without the previous error.
3. Verify that the 404 page displays correctly when navigating to a non-existent route.
