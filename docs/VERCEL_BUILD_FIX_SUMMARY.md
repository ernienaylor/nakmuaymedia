# Vercel Build Fix Summary

## Issue

During the Vercel build process, an error was encountered with the `/_not-found` page:

```
Error: useTheme must be used within a ThemeContextProvider
```

This error occurred because the static generation process was trying to render components that use the `useTheme` hook, but the `ThemeContextProvider` was not properly initialized during static generation.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive multi-layered approach to fix the issue:

1. **Completely removed the original not-found page**: Deleted `src/app/not-found.tsx` and created a new implementation in the `src/app/not-found/` directory with its own layout.

2. **Created multiple configuration files**: Added configuration files at various levels to ensure the not-found page is never statically generated:
   - `src/app/next.config.js`: Configuration for the entire app directory
   - `src/app/not-found/config.js`: Configuration specifically for the not-found page
   - `src/app/disable-static-generation.js`: Imported in the root layout to disable static generation for all pages

3. **Added special route handlers**: Created route handlers to ensure the not-found page is handled properly:
   - `src/app/not-found/route.js`: A special route handler for the not-found page
   - `src/app/not-found.js`: A placeholder file that redirects to the custom not-found page
   - `src/pages/_not-found.tsx`: A special handler for the pages directory

4. **Updated middleware**: Enhanced the middleware to handle all not-found routes and redirect them to our custom implementation.

5. **Updated Next.js configuration**: Modified `next.config.js` to:
   - Set `output: 'standalone'`
   - Add `unstable_excludeFiles` to exclude not-found pages from static generation
   - Add `experimental.disableStaticNotFound: true`
   - Add redirects and rewrites for the not-found page

6. **Updated Vercel configuration**: Modified `vercel.json` to handle 404 pages properly and added environment variables to disable static generation.

7. **Added environment variables**: Created `.env.production` with variables to disable static generation for the entire app.

## Key Files Created/Modified

1. **Configuration Files**:
   - `next.config.js`: Added configuration to disable static generation and handle not-found pages
   - `vercel.json`: Updated routes for 404 pages
   - `.env.production`: Added environment variables
   - `src/app/next.config.js`: Special configuration for the app directory
   - `src/app/disable-static-generation.js`: Imported in the root layout

2. **Special Handlers**:
   - `src/app/not-found/layout.tsx`: Special layout for the not-found page
   - `src/app/not-found/page.tsx`: Custom not-found page implementation
   - `src/app/not-found/config.js`: Configuration for the not-found page
   - `src/app/not-found/route.js`: Route handler for the not-found page
   - `src/app/not-found.js`: Placeholder file for the not-found route
   - `src/pages/_not-found.tsx`: Special handler for the pages directory
   - `src/middleware.js`: Updated to handle all not-found routes

3. **Layout Files**:
   - `src/app/layout.tsx`: Updated to import the disable-static-generation file

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Deploy the changes to Vercel.
2. Check that the build completes successfully without the previous error.
3. Verify that the 404 page displays correctly when navigating to a non-existent route.
