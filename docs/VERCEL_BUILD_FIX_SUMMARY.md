# Vercel Build Fix Summary

## Issue

During the Vercel build process, an error was encountered with the `/_not-found` page:

```
Error: useTheme must be used within a ThemeContextProvider
```

This error occurred because the static generation process was trying to render components that use the `useTheme` hook, but the `ThemeContextProvider` was not properly initialized during static generation.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive approach to fix the issue:

1. **Created a standalone not-found page**: Updated `src/app/not-found.tsx` to use inline styles and removed the "use client" directive to make it a server component.

2. **Updated the 404 page**: Applied the same standalone approach to `src/pages/404.tsx`.

3. **Disabled static generation**: Updated Next.js configuration to disable static generation for the not-found page:
   - Set `output: 'standalone'` in `next.config.js`
   - Added `unstable_excludeFiles` to exclude not-found and 404 pages
   - Created special configuration files for the not-found page
   - Added environment variables to disable static generation

4. **Added special route handling**: Created a route handler and middleware to ensure the not-found page is not statically generated.

5. **Updated Vercel configuration**: Modified `vercel.json` to handle 404 pages properly.

## Key Files Created/Modified

1. **Configuration Files**:
   - `next.config.js`: Added configuration to disable static generation
   - `vercel.json`: Added custom routes for 404 pages
   - `.env.production`: Added environment variables

2. **Special Handlers**:
   - `src/app/not-found.config.js`: Configuration for the not-found page
   - `src/app/not-found/route.js`: Route handler for the not-found page
   - `src/middleware.js`: Middleware to handle 404 pages

3. **Page Files**:
   - `src/app/not-found.tsx`: Updated to be a server component
   - `src/pages/404.tsx`: Updated to use inline styles

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Deploy the changes to Vercel.
2. Check that the build completes successfully without the previous error.
3. Verify that the 404 page displays correctly when navigating to a non-existent route.
